# Breakfast Taco Recipe 

## Servings: 8

## Time to prepare: 15 minutes

## Ingredients:
- 8 small corn or flour tortillas 
- 8 large eggs, either scrambled or fried 
- 1 can of refried beans or make them homemade! (homemade is the way to go)
- 2 avocados, peeled, pitted and sliced
- Your choice of salsa: red, green, or pico de gallo (the spicier the better) 
- Your choice of toppings: chopped fresh cilantro, cheese, sour cream and/or diced jalapeños (dress 'em up!) 


## Equipment needed:
Saucepan
Non-stick sauté pan
Bowls to hold ingredients 

## Steps for preparation:
1. Heat the refried beans in a large saucepan according to recipe instructions.

2. Meanwhile, as the beans are cooking, go ahead and scramble (see below) or fry the eggs in a non-stick sauté pan.

3. Once the beans and eggs are ready to go, it’s time to assemble the tacos!  Simply spread a spoonful of refried beans on a tortilla, top with a spoonful of scrambled eggs, then load it up with avocado, salsa and any of your preferred toppings.

4. Serve immediately and enjoy!

### Notes:
*To make scrambled eggs, whisk the eggs together in a mixing bowl until they are smooth.  (I also like to add in a generous splash of milk and spoon of butter to make them extra creamy.)  Then heat 1 tablespoon oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the eggs and cook — stirring often with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula — until they are scrambled to your desired degree of doneness.
